                    Hi there! I'm Bryan Matthew Rustardy, currently a sophomore
                    at Nanyang Technological University majoring in Information
                    Engineering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Growing up, I always had an affinity for everything tech
                    related. As I progress through my studies, I have my sights
                    set on a career in Web development. I'm excited about the
                    opportunities this field offers to make a positive impact on
                    society and contribute my skills and knowledge.
                </p>
